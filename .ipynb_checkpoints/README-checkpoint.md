# E-commerce Data Analysis

This data science project aims to help an e-commerce company decide whether to focus its efforts on mobile apps or its website. The company offers style and clothing consulting sessions in-store, and customers can order the clothes they want through the website or mobile app after the sessions.

## Objectives
The objective of this project is to analyze customer data and determine whether the company should focus its efforts on mobile apps or its website. To achieve this goal, we will follow the steps below:

1. Analyze customer data, including age, time spent on the site/app, and payment method.
2. Identify trends and patterns in the data to better understand how customers interact with the site/app.
3. Compare the performance of the site/app in terms of response time, ease of use, and other relevant factors.
4. Use statistical techniques to determine whether there is a significant difference between the performance of the site and the app.
5. Recommend whether the company should focus its efforts on mobile apps or its website.

## Data
The data we will use in this project is fictitious and was created for study purposes only. The data includes information about company customers, such as age, gender, time spent on the site/app, and payment method.

## Tools and Technologies
In this project, we will use the following tools and technologies:
- Python for data analysis and visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook for coding and documentation.
- Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.
- Statistical techniques for data analysis and performance comparison.
